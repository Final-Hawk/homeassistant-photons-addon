## Photons interactor

This addon installs and configures photons interactor. This can be used to send animations, create and set scenes and much more all through local web requests with no need for an internet interaction. This makes changes fast and reliable.

In the repository, i have added the configuration required to start and install it as an addon though homeassistant and take no credit for Delficks  amazing work.
